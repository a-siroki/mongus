  ## Description 
  This application was created to generate a high-quality, professional program for individuals to culturally integrate into the UQ society. Documenatation has been provided for individuals to follow through the iterative design process. Initial research was completed before our initial design concept was completed. Furthermore, user testing was completed through the entire project so that we ensured that we were creating a prototype for users and not ourselves.
